# Context: Meal Prep

Batch cooking for the week ahead.

## Prep Day

[WHEN DO YOU TYPICALLY DO MEAL PREP]

<!-- Example:
- Sunday afternoon/evening
- Saturday if big week ahead
- Split between Sunday (proteins) and Wednesday (refresh)
-->

## Meals Being Prepped

[WHAT ARE YOU PREPPING FOR]

<!-- Example:
- Weeknight dinners only
- Lunches for work
- Both dinners and lunches
- Breakfasts too (overnight oats, egg bites)
-->

## Planning Horizon

[HOW MANY DAYS OF MEALS]

<!-- Example:
- 3-4 days (prefer fresh for end of week)
- Full work week (5 days)
- 7 days including weekend
-->

## Storage Preferences

[FRIDGE VS. FREEZER BALANCE]

<!-- Example:
- Prefer fridge-ready meals that just need reheating
- First 3 days fridge, rest portioned for freezer
- Individual containers for grab-and-go
- Family-style containers, portion at mealtime
-->

## Reheating Context

[WHERE WILL MEALS BE REHEATED]

<!-- Example:
- Home kitchen (full equipment available)
- Office microwave only
- Both — need microwave-friendly options for lunches
- No reheating — prefer cold lunches
-->

## Variety Tolerance

[SAME MEAL REPEATEDLY, OR NEED VARIETY]

<!-- Example:
- Same meal 4 days running is fine
- "Same protein, different sauce" approach
- Need variety — components that remix into different meals
- Absolutely cannot eat the same thing twice
-->

## Prep Style

[FULL MEALS OR PREPPED COMPONENTS]

<!-- Example:
- Complete dishes portioned out (just microwave)
- Proteins + grains + veg prepped separately to mix and match
- Sauce bases and marinades ready to deploy
- Combination: some complete meals, some components
-->
