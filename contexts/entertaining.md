# Context: Entertaining

Hosting guests, from casual to formal. Guest dietary restrictions are handled per-conversation, not pre-documented here.

## Typical Headcount

[HOW MANY GUESTS DO YOU USUALLY HOST]

<!-- Example:
- Intimate dinners: 2-4 guests
- Medium gatherings: 6-8 guests
- Larger parties: 12+ occasionally
- Most common: 6 people total including myself
-->

## Hosting Style

[WHAT FORMAT DO YOU TYPICALLY PREFER]

<!-- Example:
- Sit-down plated dinner (special occasions)
- Family-style serving (most common)
- Buffet/self-serve (larger groups)
- Heavy appetizers/grazing (casual)
- Cocktail party with passed bites (parties)
-->

## Make-Ahead Preference

[HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT DONE BEFORE GUESTS ARRIVE]

<!-- Example:
- Everything prepped, just assembly/finishing when guests arrive
- Some active cooking is fine while hosting (enjoy the theater)
- Prefer dishes that hold well — no last-minute stress
-->

## Showpiece Tolerance

[HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO IMPRESS]

<!-- Example:
- Casual and comfortable — the company matters more
- One impressive centerpiece, rest simple
- Full multi-course production when in the mood
- Prefer "effortlessly delicious" over "obviously labored"
-->

## Kitchen Visibility

[IS YOUR KITCHEN OPEN TO GUESTS OR SEPARATE]

<!-- Example:
- Open floor plan — guests will watch and chat while I cook
- Separate kitchen — need dishes that don't require last-minute attention
- Semi-open — can do some finishing but nothing too involved
-->

## Beverage Pairing

[DO YOU WANT WINE/COCKTAIL PAIRING SUGGESTIONS WITH MENUS]

<!-- Example:
- Yes, specific recommendations appreciated
- General guidance only (e.g., "pairs well with a bold red")
- No, handling separately
- Include cocktail suggestions too
-->

## Office/Work Entertaining

[FOR WORK-CONTEXT ENTERTAINING]

<!-- Example:
- Typical group size: 8-12 people
- Transport considerations: needs to travel well
- Always include vegetarian options
- Charcuterie boards are a go-to
- Budget-conscious but still impressive
