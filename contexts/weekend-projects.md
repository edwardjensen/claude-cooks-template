# Context: Weekend Projects

Ambitious cooking when time and energy permit.

## Time Budget

[HOW MANY HOURS ARE REASONABLE FOR A WEEKEND PROJECT]

<!-- Example:
- Half day (3-4 hours active cooking)
- Full day if really worth it
- Okay with "start Saturday, eat Sunday" projects
-->

## Ambition Level

[WHAT COUNTS AS A "PROJECT"]

<!-- Example:
- Multi-component restaurant-style dishes
- Fresh pasta from scratch
- Bread and pastry that require time
- Long braises and slow cooks
- Fermentation/curing that spans days
- All of the above — go big or go home
-->

## Multi-Day Projects

[ARE YOU INTERESTED IN PROJECTS THAT SPAN MULTIPLE DAYS]

<!-- Example:
- Dry-brining proteins overnight
- Fermentation projects (kimchi, pickles, hot sauce)
- Curing (gravlax, duck prosciutto, bacon)
- Bread with long cold ferments
- Yes to all — I like projects that span the week
-->

## Learning Goals

[TECHNIQUES OR CUISINES YOU'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP]

<!-- Example:
- Getting better at French sauces
- Exploring Thai cooking
- Perfecting pizza dough
- Learning to butcher whole chickens
- Fermentation and preservation
-->

## Equipment Deep Dives

[PROJECTS THAT LEVERAGE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT]

<!-- Example:
- Sous vide marathon (multi-protein cook)
- Torch-forward preparations
- Convection experiments
- Stand mixer baking projects
- Pressure cooker one-pot experiments
-->

## Acceptable Mess Level

[HOW MUCH KITCHEN CHAOS IS OKAY]

<!-- Example:
- Weekend = okay to use every pot
- Still prefer contained chaos
- Will clean as I go
- Okay with a bomb zone if the result is worth it
-->
