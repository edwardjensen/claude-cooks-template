Low-effort cooking for one after a long day.

## Time Budget

<!-- Example:
- Ideal: 20-30 minutes
- Maximum: 45 minutes (for something really worthwhile)
- Most nights: 30 minutes or less
-->

## Effort Level

[HOW MUCH COGNITIVE LOAD IS ACCEPTABLE]

<!-- Example:
- "Just tell me what to do with minimal decisions"
- Keep it to 5 ingredients or fewer
- One main technique, not three things happening at once
-->

<!-- Alternative:
- "Simple but I can handle a few steps"
- Don't mind some prep work if the cooking itself is hands-off
-->

## Dishes/Cleanup Tolerance

[HOW MUCH CLEANUP ARE YOU WILLING TO DO]

<!-- Example:
- One pan maximum, ideally
- Sheet pan dinners are ideal
- "I'll deal with dishes tomorrow" (willing to use more if needed)
-->

- Warm and cozy: soups, stews from freezer
- Quick and fresh: salads with good toppings
-->

## Acceptable Shortcuts

## Portion Considerations

[SINGLE SERVING OR PLANNED LEFTOVERS]

- Cook for two, lunch tomorrow
- Make 4 portions, freeze 2 for emergency meals
-->
