# Kitchen Equipment

## Cooking Surfaces

[YOUR STOVETOP AND OVEN SETUP]

<!-- Example:
- Gas range with 4 burners
- Standard electric oven
- Toaster oven for small items
-->

## Special Equipment

[NOTABLE TOOLS BEYOND THE BASICS]

<!-- Example:
- Stand mixer
- Food processor
- Instant Pot
- Cast iron skillet
- Dutch oven
-->

## General Inventory

[OVERVIEW OF YOUR STANDARD KITCHEN EQUIPMENT]

<!-- Example:
Reasonably well-stocked kitchen including:
- Basic pots and pans
- Baking sheets and mixing bowls
- Standard utensils and gadgets
- Instant-read thermometer
-->

<!-- Note what you have and what you're missing. If you don't have
     a stand mixer or food processor, that's worth mentioning so
     recipes don't assume you have one. -->

## Implications for Recipe Design

[HOW YOUR EQUIPMENT AFFECTS RECIPES]

<!-- Example:
- No stand mixer—prefer recipes that don't require one, or provide hand-mixing alternatives
- Have an Instant Pot—can use for quick braises and beans
- Standard oven only—no convection adjustments needed
-->
